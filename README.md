This study investigates the optimization of radio propagation path loss models for suburban areas, aiming to improve the predictive accuracy of the COST-231 Hata model. Measurement data were gathered from extensive drive test campaigns conducted in three suburban locations in Lagos State and Ogun State, Nigeria: Yaba, Sango Ota, and Ijebu Ode, all at an operating frequency of 1800 MHz The baseline COST-231 model, along with established models such as Okumura-Hata and Egli, was compared to the measured path loss values to assess accuracy. To improve prediction performance, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Genetic Algorithm (GA) techniques were employed to fine-tune model parameters. The optimized models were then benchmarked against the baseline and other traditional models using performance metrics like Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). Results show that both PSO and GA-optimized models significantly reduced prediction errors across all three suburban areas, with PSO performing slightly better. Further analysis revealed that the optimized models consistently outperformed the baseline COST-231, Okumura-Hata, and Egli models, providing more reliable predictions of signal attenuation. The findings demonstrate the potential of metaheuristic optimization to adapt empirical path loss models to specific environments, offering improved tools for planning and deploying dependable wireless communication systems.
